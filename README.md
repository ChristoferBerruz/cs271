# CS 271 - Machine Learning Project


## Python environment
This repository is intended to be self-contained and be able to run in Google Collaboratory
with CUDA accelerators. As a result, `conda` is the prefered mechanism
of installing the dependencies. Install [Anaconda or miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/)

Once conda is installed, simply create an environment using

```
conda env create -f conda_environment.yml
```
